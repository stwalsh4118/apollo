## Requirements

1. Each `ModuleItem` in the sidebar shows a thin progress bar beneath the module title
2. Progress bar width = (completed lessons / total lessons) * 100%
3. Display "X / Y completed" text alongside the bar
4. Zero progress: show empty bar (or no bar if module has no lessons)
5. Uses the progress map already threaded through the sidebar (from task 4-5)

## Implementation Plan

1. Update `ModuleItem` to compute completed count from the progress map and total lesson count
2. Add a progress bar element (div with background fill, Tailwind styling)
3. Add the "X / Y completed" label

## Test Plan

- Progress bar renders with correct width percentage
- Label shows correct completed/total count
- Bar is visually styled (thin, colored fill, contrasting track)
- Browser verification with Playwright

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._

## Files Modified

- `web/src/components/ModuleItem.tsx`
