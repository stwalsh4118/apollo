# [4-8] Concept chips on lessons

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Render clickable concept badges near the top of each lesson, showing key concepts taught or referenced in that lesson. Clicking a chip navigates to the concept detail page.

## Requirements

1. Concept chips appear below the lesson title and reading time, above the content sections
2. Each chip shows the concept name as a clickable badge
3. Clicking a chip navigates to `/concepts/:id` (route may not have a page yet — that's OK, the route should exist for future PBI 11)
4. Concepts come from the `LessonFull.concepts` array (already available in the topic full response)
5. Chips styled as small rounded badges (e.g., pill-shaped, subtle background color)
6. If no concepts are associated with the lesson, the section is not rendered

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `/concepts/:id` route to the router (renders a placeholder page or redirects)
2. Create `ConceptChip` component for individual concept badges
3. Create `ConceptChips` wrapper component for the row of chips
4. Integrate into `LessonContent` — pass concepts from the full topic data down to the lesson view
5. The concept list needs to flow from `CourseViewPage` (which has `TopicFull` with `ModuleFull[]` → `LessonFull[]` → `ConceptSummary[]`)

## Test Plan

- Concept chips render for lessons that have associated concepts
- Chips do not render when lesson has no concepts
- Each chip displays the concept name
- Clicking a chip navigates to `/concepts/:id`
- Route exists and doesn't error (even if page is a placeholder)
- Browser verification with Playwright

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._
