# 5-2: Knowledge Pool Summary Schema

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the JSON Schema file at `schemas/knowledge_pool_summary.json` that defines the format of the `knowledge_pool_summary.json` context file the orchestrator writes before spawning research sessions. This schema documents the contract between the Go orchestrator and the research skill prompt.

## Requirements

1. Schema matches the structure from PRD 6.5:
   - `existing_topics`: array of objects with `id` (string) and `modules` (array of strings)
   - `existing_concepts`: array of concept slug strings
2. Both arrays may be empty (for the first research session when the pool is empty)
3. Schema enforces required fields and correct types
4. File location: `schemas/knowledge_pool_summary.json`

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `schemas/knowledge_pool_summary.json` as a JSON Schema document
2. Define the `existing_topics` array item schema (id + modules)
3. Define the `existing_concepts` array as string items
4. Mark both top-level properties as required (but arrays can be empty)

## Test Plan

- Schema file is valid JSON
- Schema validates an example matching PRD 6.5 (positive test)
- Schema validates an empty pool `{"existing_topics": [], "existing_concepts": []}` (positive test)
- Schema rejects missing required properties (negative test)

## Verification

_To be completed during implementation._

## Files Modified

- `schemas/knowledge_pool_summary.json` (new)
