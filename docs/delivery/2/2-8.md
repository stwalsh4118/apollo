# [2-8] Knowledge Graph Endpoints

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement the knowledge graph endpoints that return node and edge data for visualization (used by PBI 12's D3.js concept map). The full graph returns all topics and concepts as nodes, with edges from prerequisites, concept references, and topic relations. The topic subgraph scopes to a single topic's concepts and their connections.

## Requirements

1. Add to repository:
   - `GraphRepository` interface with:
     - `GetFullGraph(ctx) (*GraphData, error)` — all nodes and edges
     - `GetTopicGraph(ctx, topicID) (*GraphData, error)` — subgraph for one topic
2. Nodes: topics (type="topic") and concepts (type="concept") with id, label, and metadata
3. Edges from three sources:
   - `topic_prerequisites`: source=topic, target=prerequisite, type=priority (essential/helpful/deep_background)
   - `concept_references`: source=concept, target=lesson's topic, type="reference"
   - `topic_relations`: source=topic_a, target=topic_b, type=relation_type
4. Topic subgraph: topic node + its concepts + edges involving those nodes
5. Register handlers:
   - `GET /api/graph` → full graph
   - `GET /api/graph/topic/{id}` → topic subgraph
6. Handle 404 when topic ID not found (for subgraph)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `api/internal/repository/graph.go` — GraphRepository interface + SQLite implementation
2. Full graph queries:
   - Nodes: `SELECT id, title, 'topic' as type FROM topics` UNION `SELECT id, name, 'concept' as type FROM concepts`
   - Edges: three separate queries for prerequisites, references, relations
3. Topic subgraph: filter nodes to topic + its concepts (`WHERE defined_in_topic = ?`), filter edges to those involving returned node IDs
4. Create `api/internal/handler/graph.go` — HTTP handlers
5. Register routes in `server.go`

## Test Plan

- **Full graph nodes**: Seed 2 topics + 3 concepts, verify all returned as nodes with correct types
- **Full graph edges**: Seed prerequisite + reference + relation, verify all edge types present
- **Topic subgraph**: Seed 2 topics each with concepts, request subgraph for one, verify only relevant nodes/edges returned
- **Topic subgraph not found**: Request nonexistent topic, returns 404
- **Empty graph**: No data seeded, returns empty nodes and edges arrays
