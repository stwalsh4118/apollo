# [3-10] Lesson navigation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement prev/next lesson navigation within the course view. Navigation works within a module (previous/next lesson) and across module boundaries (last lesson of module N → first lesson of module N+1, and vice versa).

## Requirements

1. Prev/Next navigation bar at the bottom of the lesson content area
2. **Within module**: navigate to adjacent lessons by sort order
3. **Cross-module**: at the end of a module, "Next" goes to the first lesson of the next module; at the start, "Prev" goes to the last lesson of the previous module
4. Navigation buttons show the target lesson title
5. First lesson of first module: no "Prev" button (or disabled)
6. Last lesson of last module: no "Next" button (or disabled)
7. Navigation updates the selected lesson in the sidebar (highlight sync)
8. Scroll to top of content on navigation

## Implementation Plan

1. Create navigation utility function: given the full topic tree and current lesson ID, compute prev/next lesson IDs and titles
2. Create `web/src/components/LessonNavigation.tsx` — prev/next bar
3. Integrate into `LessonContent` at the bottom
4. Sync sidebar selection on navigation
5. Add scroll-to-top on lesson change

## Test Plan

- Next button navigates to the next lesson within a module
- Prev button navigates to the previous lesson within a module
- Cross-module navigation: next from last lesson goes to first lesson of next module
- Cross-module navigation: prev from first lesson goes to last lesson of previous module
- First lesson of topic: Prev is hidden/disabled
- Last lesson of topic: Next is hidden/disabled
- Navigation buttons show correct target lesson title
- Sidebar highlight updates on navigation
- Content scrolls to top on lesson change
