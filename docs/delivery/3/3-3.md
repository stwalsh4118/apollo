# [3-3] App routing & layout shell

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Configure React Router v7 with client-side routes and build the responsive app layout shell. The layout includes a top-level navigation area and a content region that adapts between the topic list view and the course view with sidebar.

## Requirements

1. Install React Router v7: `react-router`
2. Define routes:
   - `/` — Topic list page
   - `/topics/:id` — Course view (module sidebar + lesson content)
3. Create layout component with:
   - App header/nav bar with "Apollo" branding and back-to-home link
   - Main content area (full-width for topic list, sidebar+content for course view)
4. Responsive behaviour: sidebar collapses on small screens
5. 404 catch-all route with friendly message

## Implementation Plan

1. Install `react-router`
2. Create `web/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx` — shared header + `<Outlet />`
3. Create placeholder page components: `TopicListPage.tsx`, `CourseViewPage.tsx`, `NotFoundPage.tsx`
4. Configure router in `web/src/router.tsx` with route definitions
5. Wire router into `App.tsx`

**External Packages**: This task requires research and a guide document for: `react-router` (v7)

## Test Plan

- Navigation between `/` and `/topics/:id` works without page reload
- Browser back/forward works correctly
- Direct URL access to `/topics/some-id` renders course view
- Unknown routes show 404 page
- Layout header renders on all routes
