## Requirements

1. Fetch topics via `useTopics()` TanStack Query hook
2. Render topic cards in a responsive grid layout
3. Each card shows:
   - Topic title (linked to `/topics/:id`)
   - Difficulty badge (beginner/intermediate/advanced with colour coding)
   - Description (truncated if long)
   - Module count
4. Loading state while data fetches
5. Error state if API is unreachable
6. Empty state if no topics exist

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `web/src/pages/TopicListPage.tsx`
2. Create `web/src/components/TopicCard.tsx`
3. Create `web/src/components/DifficultyBadge.tsx`
4. Wire up `useTopics()` hook with loading/error/empty states
5. Style cards with Tailwind (responsive grid: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)

## Test Plan

- Page renders topic cards when API returns data
- Loading spinner/skeleton shows during fetch
- Error message displays when API is unreachable
- Empty state renders when no topics exist
- Cards link to correct `/topics/:id` URL
- Difficulty badge shows correct colour per level

## Verification

- TypeScript compilation passes
- ESLint passes
- Vite build succeeds
- Topic cards render in responsive grid (1/2/3 cols)
- Difficulty badge colour-coded (green/yellow/red) with capitalize
- Description truncated via line-clamp-2
- Module count with singular/plural
- Loading, error, and empty states handled

## Files Modified

- `web/src/pages/TopicListPage.tsx` — Full implementation with useTopics hook
- `web/src/components/TopicCard.tsx` — Topic card with link, badge, description, count
- `web/src/components/DifficultyBadge.tsx` — Colour-coded difficulty badge
